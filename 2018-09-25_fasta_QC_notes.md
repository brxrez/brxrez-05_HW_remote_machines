In this script which ran invertebrate, animal, crab mitochondrial, and plant fasta files demonstrated unique findings. After running each fasta file separately, it was clear to see that each file contained unique output. For instance, in inverterbates, the first three lines display nothing other than a note that says "this is a file about some animals I think?". The last three lines output blank lines, just like the animal fasta file. In the crab mitochondrial mRNA file it is observed that there are deletions "--". Moreover, it outputs species names rather than a random string of numbers and letters. Another unique finding is that in the plant fasta file some base pairs demonstrate "N", unlike the other sequences. Overall, some fasta files show actual sequence data while some are missing or show odd comments. Further analysis of invertebrates and plant fasta files should be done in order to ensure that data can be extracted from them.
